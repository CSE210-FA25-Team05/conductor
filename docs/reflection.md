# Project 1 Reflection

## What went well

Coordination and organization within each sub-team, along with like integrating each group's end results went very well in my opinion -Weston

I liked when we used polls so that everyone on the team could have a voice in decisions. -Graham

## What to improve

I guess the documentation and like the github workflow could be improved on, but it was a 1 week project -Weston

It felt like communication between different sub-teams (like frontend and backend) was a little difficult. Also, the professor keeps bringing up that we should interact with our stakeholders more. And also I feel like details from meetings sometimes get forgotten afterwards. -Graham

## Plan for improvement

We can do like the github issues and tasks, and also maybe have tests for each push/merge -Weston

For communication between sub-teams, it might be nice to have access to the other sub-teams' slack channels so we can see what they're discussing or address that team directly. For stakeholder interactions, maybe we should try going to professor office hours each week or be more open to asking the professor questions when we have to make design choices. For meeting details, we could have someone take notes during each meeting and post them to slack later so that group members can review the important takeaways from the meeting. -Graham
