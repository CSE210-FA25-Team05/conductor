# Project 1 Reflection

## What went well

Coordination and organization within each sub-team, along with like integrating each group's end results went very well in my opinion -Weston

## What to improve

I guess the documentation and like the github workflow could be improved on, but it was a 1 week project -Weston

## Plan for improvement

We can do like the github issues and tasks, and also maybe have tests for each push/merge -Weston
