# TA Meeting Notes

## Meeting 1 (10/20/2025)

Our first TA meeting included everyone. However, moving forward, only the team leads are required. 

### Basic Guidelines
- All grading depends on individual contributions 
- Document every meeting (including attendance)
    - One place for documentation (GitHub) 
- Slack
    - Tag TA in questions in slack
    - Add TA to every slack channel
