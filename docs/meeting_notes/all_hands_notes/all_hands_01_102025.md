# All Hands 01 - 10/25/25

# Attendance
- Everyone is present.

# Questions
- **Do we need a separate team for documentation?**  
  - No, the project probably won't need this.

# Overview
## Project Logistics
- This will be similar to the last project, but more structured.  
- We'll be doing CI/CD pipelines to maintain consistency.  
- **GitHub Flow** will be the primary CI/CD pipeline tool.  
- **GitHub Issues** will be the main method of bug/issue/progress tracking:
  - Every feature/bug/task will be made into an issue and will feed into the main branch.
- **Kanban board** will be used to track the project (oversight by PMs).
- When you are assigned an issue, branch off `main`, work on that feature.
- Most commits should be non-breaking — all tests should work and be integrable into the main branch.
- When you finish a feature, make a pull request and confirm that no breakage occurs.

## When Creating an Issue
- Make sure to assign people (groups) to it.

## Pull Requests
- Follow the template for all pull requests.
- When you finish a feature:
  - Make a pull request and confirm that no breakage occurs.
  - Tag both PMs (only one approval required).
  - Tag the rest of the team as well.
  - Make any documentation updates.
  - GitHook will automatically format the code when it pushes.
  - Once approved, it will be merged into `main`.

## Possible TODOs
- Create a template for all pull requests.
- Might use the **Projects** feature in GitHub.

## Due Date
- **Code Freeze:** Last Thursday of instruction.  
- **Presentation:** Finals week.

## Project Options
- Interested in doing **Option #2 – Semi-Structured.**

## Group Logistics
- Likely to have a quick sub-meeting after every lecture.
- Keep Git-related issues in the Git tracker.
- Use the Issues feature for documentation.
