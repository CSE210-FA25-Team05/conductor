# TA Meeting Notes

## Meeting 1 (10/20/2025)

Our first TA meeting included everyone. However, moving forward, only the team leads are required.

### Basic Guidelines

- All grading depends on individual contributions
- Document every meeting (including attendance)
  - One place for documentation (GitHub)
- Slack
  - Tag TA in questions in slack
  - Add TA to every slack channel
