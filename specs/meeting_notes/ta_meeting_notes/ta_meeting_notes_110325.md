# TA Meeting Notes

## Meeting (November 3, 2025)

### Decisions & Requirements

#### Documentation

- Write an ADR (Architecture Decision Record) for every decision (e.g., why Fastify)
- All meeting notes — including team, TA, and sub-team — must be documented in GitHub

#### Process

- Add Sammed as a reviewer on every PR
- Sprint and sprint retrospective assignment will be released today
- Next week we might have to talk on it

#### Security

- Basic protocols are fine
- OAuth-level security (does not need to be top-tier)
- Baseline for security is authentication

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

As you finalize your choices for tools, frameworks and services to use, please make sure to create Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for each significant technical decision. For example:

- Why you selected a particular framework
- Database choice
- Hosting option
- Any major library dependency

#### Why ADRs are Important

- Capture the reasoning behind each decision (context, trade-offs and alternatives)
- Help future contributors understand the "why" behind your architecture
- Encourage structured decision-making and technical clarity

#### ADR Structure

Each ADR should be a Markdown file in `/specs/adr` in your repo, with the following structure:

1. **Context**: what decision needs to be made and why
2. **Options considered**: what alternatives were evaluated
3. **Decision**: what was chosen and why
4. **Consequences**: trade-offs or implications

#### Process

- Once your ADR is ready, please have a discussion with the TA before finalizing on it
- This ensures that your decisions are well-aligned with the project's scope and constraints
